Hi! Welcome to my GitHub Page. My name is Cristina Rosa Casiano, and I'm a publishing and writing student at Emerson College. I'm learning the basics of HTML, CSS, and XML and would like to share a bit of myself with you all as I practice coding. Refer to my resume to learn more about me, or check out my Code Pen to follow my progress.
